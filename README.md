My attempt for our client DriverPass was not my best work. I failed to take into account all the details before starting. Their system was meant to be only the "On the Road" appointments and the details that that would entail. Knowing what I know now I would have built a strong scheduling system to keep the cars running on time and lessen the headaches of possible double bookings. The users needs are the job, if a user is not pleased with the work then the working is not done. My key learning point from this is to look over every detail and every piece of intel before going into the project. This is something I will learn from and not repeat.
